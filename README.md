# MyWeb
Here I will be storing most of my web development notes and projects that I do to keep track of it.

## I
I have started my journey in web-development from july-aug 2020 and currently I am able to make the tutor's projects on frontend and backend with tech. stack of nodejs,express,ejs,and learning mongoDB++ and exploring the world of making projects ;
<br><br>

#
 - made the notes app which is live on heroku , but here I haven't added authentication so everyone can see each other's Notes and it's kind of not good for real world situation. Styling is minimal as I just want to tryout how to deploy :))...
[Notes App](https://pacific-harbor-40136.herokuapp.com/)<br>
For This ==> html,css,javascript,nodejs(& express),ejs templating,mongoDB and atlast heroku
<!-- TO change that code clone that and then make changes and re push it to heroku -->
