# MyWeb
Here I will be storing most of my web development notes and projects that I do to keep track of it.

## What I Have Done till now
I have started my journey in web-development from july-aug 2020 and currently I am able to make the tutor's projects on frontend and backend with tech. stack of nodejs,express,ejs,and learning mongoDB++ and exploring the world of making projects ;
<br><br>

Just few days ago I learned Bootstrap and amazed by it's features and made this portfolio site just for fun ! ha ha<br>
[Currently Not added content just template ha ha End sem exam is coming ](https://ketanrtd713.github.io/TryingGithubPages/#contact)
<br><br>
So Currently I am working on MyPersonal Blog Project which part of Angela yu's challenges..and I think it will not take too much time so if you have any project idea that a begineer nodejs develo[er
should do then suggestions are welcomed ..so let me start making this and ya atlast I want to experience how hosting looks like ha ha:)

 made the notes app which is live on heroku , but here I haven't added authentication so everyone can see each other's Notes and it's kind of not good for real world situation. Styling is minimal as I just want to tryout how to deploy :))...
[Notes App](https://pacific-harbor-40136.herokuapp.com/)
<!-- TO change that code clone that and then make changes and re push it to heroku -->
